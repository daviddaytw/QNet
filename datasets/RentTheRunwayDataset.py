    abstract = {Product size recommendation and fit prediction are critical in order to improve customers' shopping experiences and to reduce product return rates. Modeling customers' fit feedback is challenging due to its subtle semantics, arising from the subjective evaluation of products, and imbalanced label distribution. In this paper, we propose a new predictive framework to tackle the product fit problem, which captures the semantics behind customers' fit feedback, and employs a metric learning technique to resolve label imbalance issues. We also contribute two public datasets collected from online clothing retailers.},
