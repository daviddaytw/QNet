\section{Acknowledgments}
AAAI is especially grateful to Peter Patel Schneider for his work in implementing the original aaai.sty file, liberally using the ideas of other style hackers, including Barbara Beeton. We also acknowledge with thanks the work of George Ferguson for his guide to using the style and BibTeX files --- which has been incorporated into this document --- and Hans Guesgen, who provided several timely modifications, as well as the many others who have, from time to time, sent in suggestions on improvements to the AAAI style. We are especially grateful to Francisco Cruz, Marc Pujol-Gonzalez, and Mico Loretan for the improvements to the Bib\TeX{} and \LaTeX{} files made in 2020.

The preparation of the \LaTeX{} and Bib\TeX{} files that implement these instructions was supported by Schlumberger Palo Alto Research, AT\&T Bell Laboratories, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, The Live Oak Press, LLC, and AAAI Press. Bibliography style changes were added by Sunil Issar. \verb+\+pubnote was added by J. Scott Penberthy. George Ferguson added support for printing the AAAI copyright slug. Additional changes to aaai22.sty and aaai22.bst have been made by Francisco Cruz, Marc Pujol-Gonzalez, and Mico Loretan.

\bigskip
\noindent Thank you for reading these instructions carefully. We look forward to receiving your electronic files!
